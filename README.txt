This is going to mostly be a copy of the code Simaan sent me, but I figure it's a good idea for me to come up with my own so I can learn.

In general:
Derive=function that symbolically generates another function to compute some expression
Compute=function intended on using the derived expression and real numbers to create some numeric result
Sim=Dynamically simulates and visualizes some robot (executable)
-SimMB simulates the manufacturing base robot
-SimMLS simulates the MLS textbook eaxmple 4.3 robot
-SimTLP simulates a simple two link planar manipulator
-ViewSim views a simulated robot
